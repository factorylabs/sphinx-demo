h1. Getting Started

Getting set up is pretty simple - this app doesn't have a frontend, just a simple Place model with some basic data so you can play around with Sphinx searching in script/console

- Clone the repo - git clone git://github.com/factorylabs/sphinx-demo.git
- Run ./setup.sh
- Run script/console and go to town

setup.sh will take care of the following steps:

- Install the gems (rake gems:install)
- Create the DB (rake db:create)
- Migrate (rake db:migrate)
- Index (rake ts:index)
- Populate seed data (rake db:seed)
- Start Sphinx (rake ts:start)
